# Creds Class

The Creds class is a class that handles login credentials. The source is located at simplematrixbotlib/auth.py.

### Creating an instance of the Creds class
An instance can be created using the following python code.
```python
creds = botlib.Creds(
    homeserver="https://example.org", 
    username="username", 
    password="password", 
    session_stored_file="session.txt"
    )
```
or
```python
creds = botlib.Creds(
    homeserver="https://example.org",
    username="username", 
    login_token="MDA..gZ2",
    session_stored_file="session.txt"
    )
```
or
```python
creds = botlib.Creds(
    homeserver="https://example.org",
    username="username",
    access_token="syt_c2...DTJ",
    session_stored_file="session.txt"
    )
```
The homeserver and username arguments are always required.
The `password` argument may be replaced by either the `login_token` argument or the `access_token` argument.
The `login_token` is used with handling SSO logins (See the [Matrix Docs](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/sso-for-client-developers#handling-sso)) and can only be used to authenticate once.
The `access_token` is generated by logging in using a different login method.

The optional `session_stored_file` argument is the location of a file used by the bot to store session information such as the generated access token and device name.
When a `session_stored_file` is present, the Api class will prefer an existing `access_token` over a password or login token given in the Creds class automatically.
