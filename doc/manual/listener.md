### How to use the Listener class
The Listener class is a class that is used to specify reactions to the events that occur in Matrix rooms. The source is located at simplematrixbotlib/listener.py

### Accessing a Listener instance
An instance of the Listener class is automatically created when an instance of the Bot class is created. An example is shown in the following python code.
```python
bot = botlib.Bot(creds)
bot.listener #Instance of the Listener class
```

### Using the on_message_event decorator
The on_message_event method of the Listener class may be used to execute actions based on messages that are sent in rooms that the bot is a member of. Example usage of on_message_event is shown in the following python code.
```python
@bot.listener.on_message_event
async def example(room, message):
    print(f"A message({message.content}) was sent in a room({room.room_id}).")

```
When any message is sent, the function will be called with room as a [Room object](https://matrix-nio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nio.html#nio.rooms.MatrixRoom) representing each room that that the bot is a member of, and message as a [RoomMessage object](https://matrix-nio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nio.html?highlight=nio.events.room_events.roommessage.content#nio.events.room_events.RoomMessage) representing the message that was sent.

### Using the on_custom_event decorator
The on_custom_event method of the Listener class may be used to execute actions based on any event that is sent in rooms that the bot is a member of. Example usage of on_custom_event is shown in the following python code.
```python
import nio

@bot.listener.on_custom_event(nio.InviteMemberEvent)
async def example(room, event):
    if event.membership == "join":
        print(f"A user joined the room({room.room_id}).")
    if event.membership == "leave":
        print(f"A user left the room({room.room_id}).")

```
The on_custom_event method is almost identical to the on_message_event method. on_custom_event takes an argument that allows the developer to specify the event type for the Bot to respond to. Information on events can be found in the [matrix-nio docs](https://matrix-nio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nio.html#module-nio.events).

#### Using the on_startup decorator
The on_startup method of the Listener class may be used to execute actions upon the starting of the Bot. Example usage of the on_startup method is show in the following python code.
```python
@bot.listener.on_startup
async def room_joined(room_id):
    print(f"This account is a member of a room with the id {room_id}")
```
When the bot is run, for each room that the Bot is a member of, the function will be called with room_id as a string that corresponds to the room_id of the room.
